# MKLeo Generator
### Project Overview
This project was a passion project made for the Smash Brothers community which used Australia's main database
[ausmash](https://ausmash.com.au/data) to calculate routes on which a player could relate their wins back to a specific player.

This project was created as it started as a joke that all Australian players could be routed back to the #1 Player (MkLeo) in the world through indirect and direct wins, hence the tiers. 

## Ways to Use this Website
