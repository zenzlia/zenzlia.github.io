# MKLeo Generator
### Project Overview
This project was a passion project made for the Smash Brothers community which used Australia's main database
[ausmash](https://ausmash.com.au/data) to calculate routes on which a player could relate their wins back to a specific player.

The idea of Mkleo numbers originate from [Bacon Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) and [Erdos Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) which theorise that any person can be linked to a certain person given that they are within in the industry and that a link is able to be initially established. 

This project works similarly to these numbers with the person to link to being the #1 Player in the world (MkLeo) and links being that of beating the person in the link above. Originally this project was created as it started as a joke that all Australian players could be routed back to Mkleo through indirect and direct wins.

Similar websites that exist are: https://oracleofbacon.org/ and https://oakland.edu/enp/compute/ which calculate Bacon and Erdos numbers respectively.
