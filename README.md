# Welcome to my Personal Projects Repo
Hello there, I see you've found this read me. My name is Natalie and I'm currently a third year SWE studying at UQ. I enjoy programming, designing and playing games, which is pretty much what this repo exists for.

Whenever I have spare time or interest in a game I decide to make a website for it that I feel will be interesting or useful for public use. 

Since I am using github pages to host the website I am unable to host server side programs so I run all my scripts locally and transfer the data manually onto the repo. 

The main languages/tools I use for this repo are: 
* Python 3 - For API calls and data sorting/parsing
* JavaScript - For data display and interaction. Most data collected is converted to a JS file for easier visualisation.
  * Most of my websites use JQuery 3
  
* CSS - Page structure and design
* HTML - website structure

# Repo Projects
Below is a list of all the projects I would like to showcase in this repo. Feel free to look at other projects if you'd like to though. A lot of these involve gaming so please contact me if you're confused as to the context of the project, I tried my best to explain it haha. Ok enjoy !

## [Character States](https://zenzlia.github.io/CharacterStates/index.html)
Uses the [ausmash API](https://ausmash.com.au/api) to pull player data and display the amount of unique players per state and sort them by skill rating gain. This was my first attempt at sorting large JSON files for displaying and would later be used as the basis for a Uni project.

## [Clicker](https://zenzlia.github.io/Clicker/index.html)
JavaScript game made on a flight home earlier this year. This game was made as a mini challenge to me to see if I could recreate a game in a short time span. While unfinished, I wanted to share this project as it is the first game I've ever programmed using my own designs and logic.

This game is based off [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker) but uses pretzels instead.

## [Critter Costs](https://zenzlia.github.io/CritterCosts/index.html)
A project made to assist with playing [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://www.nintendo.com.au/catalogue/animal-crossing-new-horizons) to show the price of each critter (fish or bug) that appears in the game and can be searched for with a search bar I implemented. I wanted this design to be very simplistic yet appealing as well as easy to use on both desktop and mobile.

## [How Much?](https://zenzlia.github.io/HowMuch/index.html)
A single you-owe-me website that was made to track the amount of money I owed someone. I made this as I was too lazy to do basic maths and was getting sick of constantly rewriting down new values. This website, while simple, was me playing around with local storage and input prompting.

## [Smash Banner](https://zenzlia.github.io/SmashBanner/index.html)
A small web application I made for personal use. This was my first website I created for this repo (excluding the index page) and was my first atttempt at using JQuery outside of Uni projects. 

The Stage Banner acts as a companion application for the game Smash Ultimate and allows two players to choose a stage to play on.

This application would serve as influence for other smash and stream websites which would also be used within the community.
